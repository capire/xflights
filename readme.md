# @capire/xflights

This is a reuse package to manage and serve master data like _Airlines_, _Airports_, and _Flights_.
It publishes a [pre-built client package](#publishing-apis), that is used in the [xtravels](https://github.com/capire/xtravels) application.

## Domain Model

The domain model is defined in [_db/schema.cds_](./db/schema.cds). It centers around normalized `FlightConnections`, which connect two `Airports` operated by an `Airline`, while entity `Flights` represents scheduled flights on specific dates with a specific aircraft and price.

## Service Interfaces

Two service interfaces are defined in [_srv/admin-service.cds_](./srv/admin-service.cds), and [_srv/data-service.cds_](./srv/data-service.cds), to serve different use cases as shown below: 

- an admin service to _maintain_ the master data from UIs or remote systems
- a data service to _consume_ it from remote applications

> The data service exposes a denormalized view of `Flights` and associated `FlightConnections` data, essentially declared like that:

> entity Flights as projection on my.Flights { 
>   *,          // all elements from Flights
>   flight.*,   // all elements from FlightConnections

> With that consumers aren't bothered with normalized data but can just consume flat data, looking like that:

## Exporting APIs

Given the respective service definition, we create a pre-built client package for the data API, which can be used from consuming apps in a plug-and-play fashion.

![](_docs/client-packages.drawio.svg)

We use `cds export` to create the API package, based on the Data Service definition:

```sh
cds export srv/data-service.cds
```

This generates a separate CAP reuse package within subfolder [_apis/data-service_](./apis/data-service/) that contains only the effective service API definitions, accompanied by automatically derived test data and i18n bundles. 

![](_docs/data-service-api.drawio.svg)

Initially, `cds export` also adds a `package.json`, which we can modify as appropriate, and did so by changing the package name to `@capire/xflights-data`:

```diff
{
- "name": "@capire/xflights-data-service",
+ "name": "@capire/xflights-data",
  ...
}
```



## Publishing APIs

We can finally share this package with consuming applications using standard ways, like `npm publish`:

```sh
cd apis/data-service
npm publish
```

> Within the [_capire_](https://github.com/capire) org, we're publishing to [GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/packages), which requires you to npm login once like that:
>
> ```sh
> npm login --scope=@capire --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
> ```
>
> As password you're using a Personal Access Token (classic) with `read:packages` scope (for retrieving and installing a package).

## Consuming APIs

Use the published client package in your consuming application by installing it via `npm`:

```sh
npm add @capire/xflights-data
```

With that, we can use the imported models as usual, and as if they were local in mashups with our own entities like so:

```cds
using { sap.capire.flights.data as imported } from '@capire/xflights-data';
entity TravelBookings { //...
  flight : Association to imported.Flights;
}
```

## Using Workspaces

Instead of exercising a workflow like that again and again:

- ( *develop* → *export* → *publish* ) → *npmjs.com* → ( *update* → *consume* )

... we can use *npm workspaces* technique to work locally and speed up things as follows:

```shell 
mkdir -p cap/works; cd cap/works
git clone https://github.com/capire/xflights
git clone https://github.com/capire/xtravels
echo '{"workspaces":["xflights","xtravels"]}' > package.json
```

Add a link to the local `@capire/xflights-data` API package, enclosed with the cloned xflights sources:

```shell
npm add ./xflights/apis/data-service
```

Check the installation using `npm ls`, which would yield output as below, showing that `@capire/xtravel`'s dependency to `@capire/xflights-data` is nicely fulfilled by a local link to `./xflights/apis/data-service`:

```shell
npm ls @capire/xflights-data
```

```zsh
works@ ~/cap/works
├── @capire/xflights-data@0.1.11 -> ./xflights/apis/data-service
└─┬ @capire/xtravels@1.0.0 -> ./xtravels
  └── @capire/xflights-data@0.1.11 deduped -> ./xflights/apis/data-service
```

Start the xtravels application → and note the sources loaded from *./xflights/apis/data-service*, and the information further below about the `sap.capire.flights.data` service mocked automatically:

```shell
cds watch xtravels
```

```zsh
[cds] - loaded model from 20 file(s):

  xtravels/srv/travel-service.cds
  xtravels/db/schema.cds
  xtravels/db/xflights.cds
  xflights/apis/data-service/index.cds
  xflights/apis/data-service/services.csn
  ...
```

```zsh
[cds] - mocking sap.capire.flights.data {
  at: [ '/odata/v4/data', '/rest/data', '/hcql/data' ],
  decl: 'xflights/apis/data-service/services.csn:3',
}
```



## Using Proxy Packages

The usage of *npm workspaces* technique as described above streamlined our workflows as follows:

- Before: ( *develop* → *export* → *publish* ) → *npmjs.com* → ( *update* → *consume* )
- After: ( *develop* → *export* ) → ( *consume* )

We can even more streamline that by eliminating the export step as follows...

Create a new subfolder `xflights-api-shortcut`  in which we add two files as follows:

```shell
mkdir xflights-api-shortcut
```

Add a `package.json` file in there with that content:

```json
{
  "name": "@capire/xflights-data",
  "dependencies": {
    "@capire/xflights": "*"
  }
}
```

And an `index.cds` file with that content:

```cds
using from '@capire/xflights/srv/data-service';
```

<details> <summary> Using the <code>cat > ... << EOF</code> technique... </summary>

  You can also create those two files from the command line as follows:
  ```shell
  cat > xflights-api-shortcut/package.json << EOF
  ```
  Copy and paste the JSON content above, then type: `EOF`, followed by ENTER.
  Repeat the same for the `index.cds` file:
  ```shell
  cat > xflights-api-shortcut/index.cds << EOF
  ```

</details>
With that in place, change our API package dependency in the workspace root as follows:

```shell
npm in ./xflights-api-shortcut
```

Check the effect of that → note how `@capire/xflights-data` dependencies now link to `./xflights-api-shortcut`:

```shell
npm ls @capire/xflights-data
```

```zsh
works@ ~/cap/works
├── @capire/xflights-data@ -> ./xflights-api-shortcut
└─┬ @capire/xtravels@1.0.0 -> ./xtravels
  └── @capire/xflights-data@ deduped -> ./xflights-api-shortcut≤
```

Start the *xtravels* application → and note the sources loaded from *./xflights-api-shortcut*, and the information further below about the `sap.capire.flights.data` service now being _served_, not _mocked_ anymore:

```shell
cds watch xtravels
```

```zsh
[cds] - loaded model from 20 file(s):

  xtravels/srv/travel-service.cds
  xtravels/db/schema.cds
  xtravels/db/xflights.cds
  xflights-api-shortcut/index.cds
  xflights/srv/data-service.cds
  xflights/db/schema.cds  
  ...
```

```zsh
[cds] - serving sap.capire.flights.data {
  at: [ '/odata/v4/data', '/rest/data', '/hcql/data' ],
  decl: 'xflights/apis/data-service/services.csn:3',
}
```

Which means we've streamlined our workflows as follows:

- Before: ( *change* → *export* → *publish* ) → *npmjs.com* → ( *update* → *consume* )
- Step 1: ( *change* → *export* ) → ( *consume* )
- Step 2: ( *change* ) → ( *consume* )
