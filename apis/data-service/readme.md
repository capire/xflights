   _Using GitHub Packages..._

</summary>

  The samples are published to the [GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/packages) registry,
  which requires you to npm login once like that:

  ```sh
  npm login --scope=@capire --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
  ```

  As password you're using a Personal Access Token (classic) with `read:packages` scope.
  Read more about it in [Authenticating to GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages).

## Usage

Then you can import and use the entities in your CDS models like this:

```cds
using { sap.capire.flights.data.Flights } from '@capire/xflights-data';
// mashup with your own entities ...
```
Find examples for that in the [_xtravels_ application](https://github.com/capire/xtravels/blob/main/db/master-data.cds).
